[Go Back](/)

You have chosen to transfer over your existing Modmail bot to Patreon hosting. See below for your current hosting method.
 - [Heroku](#heroku)
 - [Self Hosting](#self-hosting)
 - [Repl.it](#replit)


### Repl.it

Navigate to [My Repls](https://replit.com/repls){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the repl.it website, login if prompted. Choose the Modmail Bot repl (not the logviewer's).

On the side panel, click on the lock icon (Secret environment variables). Scroll down to the bottom and click **Open raw editor**.

You will be greeted with a popup text box containing your secrets, copy everything in there and send back it to Patreon Modmail DM.

If your bot is still running, press on the **Stop** button at the top and disable any uptime robots you may have enabled to stop the current bot from running. Otherwise, your bot may send duplicate messages.

Lastly, choose a memorable name for your Logviewer. You will be provided with a log URL under our **.modmail.dev** domain name. You can choose anything you like (with a few restrictions), if you feel it's reasonable, then most likely we do too! Note: only 3-16 alphanumeric characters are allowed. Send this to Patreon Modmail DM as well.
